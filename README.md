## What You Will Learn
- Create your own landing page to share all your social media accounts, portfolio, works, offerings, anything in a single place. The website is responsive and will work on any device. 
- Version Control - a key skill that every developer needs to know to track code changes.

## Tech

- CSS
- JavaScript (JS)
- [GitHub]

## Quick Use
Create a [new repository in GitHub] named as username.github.io (replace **username** with your github username)

Clone the new repository you just created
```
git clone https://github.com/username/username.github.io
```

Clone the **linker** repository and switch to branch **complete**
```
git clone https://github.com/iojason/linker.git
git checkout complete
```

Move everything within the **linker** directory into your *username.github.io* folder, then delete **linker**.
```
mv linker/* username.github.io
rm -d linker
```

Open up [VS Code] or your favorite IDE and make the necessary updates (name, tag, background image, labels/links) within index.html and linker-style.css files.

Then do a simple push
```
git add -A
git commit -am "my linker page."
git push
```
